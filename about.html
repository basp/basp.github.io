		Too much software is like Playmobil when it should be Lego instead. The art of software development is mostly in keeping complexity under control. The better you manage complexity, the quicker you can adapt to changing requirements or new feature requests. The smaller you design your building blocks the easier you can build different designs.

		Even the most rigid, untestable composition of software (legacy or not) can be mended into flexible and composable equivalents that are not only easy to understand (and document) but also can be tested in isolation in a controlled environment. This is where the real challenge of software development lies.

		Another aspect is using the right tools to solve the right problem. A lot of software development often goes with doctrine and conditioning which often leads to a fixed mindset and a narrow view on the ecosystem in which a developer finds her- or himself. A true craftsman should always keep an open mind and a wide view of a good variety of ecosystems to make sure she or he is not confined to a small array of tools when a problem requires a solution.
