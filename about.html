		Too much software is like Playmobil when it should be Lego instead. The art of software development is mostly in keeping complexity under control. The better you manage complexity, the quicker you can adapt to changing requirements or new feature requests. The smaller you design your building blocks the easier you can build different designs.

		Even the most rigid, untestable composition of software (legacy or not) can be mended into flexible and composable equivalents that are not only easy to understand (and document) but also can be tested in isolation in a controlled environment. This is where the real challenge of software development lies.
