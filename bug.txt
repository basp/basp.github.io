1. focus() doesn't work... in Chrome (of all browsers)
2. apparently focus() doesn't work well with development console open
3. *closes dev console*
4. check again
5. still doesn't work... that sucks
6. opens dev console again
7. starts logging to make sure event handlers work
8. check
9. wraps focus() in a `setTimeout` with 0 delay to just force it to back of the queue
10. still doesn't work
11. more debugging, logging, checking
12. changes everything a few times back and forth, ends up at starting point
13. notices the dev console is open... Wait... I didn't did I?
14. closes dev console for the second time
15. wraps the `focus()` in a `setTimeout` with 0 delay, again just to force it to the ends
16. refreshes the page
17. it @#$#@$@#$ works
18. has a private facepalm moment
19. removes all the clutter and fail safes and what-not
20. it looks nice and simple, will it work?
21. refresh the page.... anticipation....
22. IT WORKS!
