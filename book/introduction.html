<root><section><h2>Don't be daunted</h2><h4>The blind leading the blind</h4><p>This book came into creation as a giant section of notes and at some point I wanted to bundle some of it into a coherent textbook. The coherent book is certainly not there yet but I'm getting to the point where I feel comfortable sharing my work with others. It's definitely not a beginners book and there is some math involved as well. And I'm not that good in math so this will be fun.</p><p>If you feel daunted at any point during reading that would be my fault. I am not used to writing books like these and this is still very much a <em>work in progress</em>.</p></section><section><h4>How to read</h4><p>My main advice would be to <em>just read</em> the thing. If you get completely lost at some point just backtrack to some reasonable position and read again. Look up concepts that are unfamiliar. Try to understand them. Look at the <strong>code</strong> sections and see how they relate to the math sections. Read the text again and see if it makes more sense.</p><p>Some things in the book expect you to just read along and have the answer spilled out later. I try my best to keep these interesting but they might be annoying for you as a reader. Please let me know if you hate me for this.</p></section><section><h4>If you get stuck</h4><p>Which is more likely than unlikely with the book in its current state, sadly. If you really get stuck that means I did something wrong. Help me make this book better by getting in touch.</p></section></root>
