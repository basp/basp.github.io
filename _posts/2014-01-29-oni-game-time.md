It is there. The time has come to start dogfooding for real. No more excuses, no more tweaking of endless comments and readme's. The time is now and we need to start working on the actual game. Oh right, the end goal was always to implement something real, something playable. I'm not just here to do some Erlang pattern matching, this thing has purpose!

This will be part of a longer series of posts in which I will document how this building process goes. I will try to highlight every important piece of code that gets written. In doing this, I will probably include a lot of unimportant stuff too just to provide context and annotation. This will only involve work that has to be done as a game writer using Oni to get your world up. Any stuff that is engine work will not be described here but in seperate posts.

That being said, let's start by creating a script and start with the familiar Wizard.
