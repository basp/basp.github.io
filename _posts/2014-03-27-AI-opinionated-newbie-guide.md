Welcome to Wayfar 1444. This guide is here to help you get started playing the game but keep in mind that this is an _opinionated_ guide. That being said, it will set you upon the path of being self sufficient which is one of the primary goals.

Note that this an opionated guide so it will be full of statements that might not really be true after all. It's kinda fail safe though (at time of writing). Keep in mind though to _do experiment_ yourself outside the boundaries of what is said below whenever you feel comfortable.

#### Multiplaying
The admins have expressed it is allowed to multiplay (have two simultaneous connections on two characters) at the same time. However, they also explictly mentioned this _is within reasonable_ boundaries. This is no excuse to hammer the server, instead, use this to check for bugs that you can otherwise not see. For example, how do your actions appear to other players? Or does the bug happen with every character or only a particular one? Also you can use it to rescue a stranded ship in case you get killed in an awkward spot. 

It's not a very honorable thing to do but it __is__ allowed (and sometimes can be useful if you made a bad decision like parking your asteroid miner at the orbital starship construction platform, crafting a new ship there and forgetting you can't fly your old one back).

### About Wayfar1444
Wayfar1444 is a MOO that is built upon the hellcore. It's the only playable game I know of that has been built on it. In fact, this game and hellcore are tied together in more than one way on more than one level.

You are not here to read about the history of Wayfar1444 though. That can wait. The rest of this guide will explain how to go from a lowly newbie to a <del>pro</del> reasonably self sufficient Wayfar1444 player.

### Starting out for the first time
Starting out for the first time is a little bit different because more mechanics need to be explained. If you are completely new, start here.

TODO: Insert thingy about shuttle here so I'm not dumping everyone blindly into instructions. [Averitti's guide](https://sites.google.com/site/accordingtomariah/change-the-banner) is doing a much better job on this.

The game will explain most of the actions at this point so just play along. The game might give you a hint to add a description. It might also direct you to the next target. Feel free to follow anything the game says for fun and profit but for the guide you should go east and check out the colony dispatch terminal.

After you set your `@gender` and `@background` you can use the dispatch terminal to either link up with an existing colony or dispatch to a planet of your choice to setup your own personal colony.

Before you go though, do take a moment to `@describe me as your description here` to set a custom description. It doesn't have to be an essay - even a single line is better than nothing.

#### Note on Backgrounds
Before you can set out, the game requires you to choose a background. There is really no right or wrong choice here so I recommend you take the one that seems the right one for you and the way to want to play. 

If you really have no clue I recommend going for the ranger or botanist. These are very straightforward to complete for new players as they only depend on you having a few skills. Also, they both allow you to take up a few (or all of) the _primitive assembly_ skills too which is a nice syphon of skillpoints during your reroll. You do have a bit more control with the ranger background on __when__ you want to finish it but it also gives you one less reroll point. If you go with botanist you get to `explore` and `discover` a lot which also will add to your blueprint chip collection (more on that later, just collect these for now and store them somewhere safe).

### Setting up
After you dispatched to a planet or linked up with an existing colony, you'll find yourself with a basic set of harvesting and crafting equipment. Also you get some other helpfull items such as the datapad and handbook. Take a moment to look through your `inventory` and `examine` everything to find out what actions (commands) it supports.

Afer this check out your crafting tools (probably on the basic crafting tool) and do a `list basic` to see what things it can craft. One of these is a _pre-fab shelter kit_ which you should make as soon as possible. Before you do though, try to find a nice spot. Ideally, it has a nice long room description signalling the abundance of a lot of resources. 

Also, you want to setup near a spot that has a good variety of biomes nearby. When starting out, you really want a planet that has a plenty of forest, jungle, mountains and desert. Other biomes are required but if you have the aforementioned biomes on your planet (and preferably nearby) you'll be in a good position to craft everything you need to get spaceborn. Note that you can also use the `map` command to check out various aspects of your surroundings. The command itself will explain about its various options but the `map biome` one is the more useful.

Before you start exploring take a note of your `status` and note the amount of skillpoints available. You could probably learn some skills right now. If you are a ranger you should probably look into the primitive weapons category. If you are a botanist, check out the exploration category. If you have a different background you have to decide for yourself for now (sorry about that).

Note though, if you are unsure you can safely keep your skillpoints for now and spend them when you are sure about what skill you want.

### Crafting


### TODO (tentative list below)
* Learn the primitive assembly skills (these are useful for almost all builds, especially when starting out)

* Love the datapad that you are given; you an "lookup <thing> with datapad" and it will tell you how/what tool you need to make it

* Build shipping containers and use them to organize your things; shipping containers are only 8 inert metal (which you can find almost everywhere with

* Craft the advanced structure tool. You will need this to create better buildings.

* Craft a ranch, your new home; only noobs live in a prefab starter house.

* Get good tools: q-osmose for energy, slimfast for organic and massed for minerals; You can buy the slimfast intake component from the central complex using the terminal in your ranch.

* Build a starship complex; you'll need this to get spaceborn.

* Get spaceborne; getting spaceborne is arguably easier than getting airborne. Flying around in starships is important so you better get this down as soon as possible.

* Learn how to navigate around the Wayfar space; sometimes it's a bit tricky when there are planets that have the same name as their system. You'll eventually learn to visualize it in your head though.

* Mine gas clouds; you will eventually need stuff like prolium gas for fancy equipment. This is not usually easily obtainable on plantes. Once you get spaceborne and comfortable with flying around, you can craft an asteroid miner. Craft a gas mining module and you can fly to the nearest asteroid belt and try to find some gas clouds. Check them all until you find prolium.

* Find the nearest moon with metallic moon biome; metallic moon biome is quite rare but most moons have at least a small percentage of it. You will need this biome to find fullerene which is required for more awesome equipment. Also look for ceramic geode and some other thing I can't remember. Just look around for exotic stuf.

* Chances are (unless you are already on Wayfar, and this guide will suck for you in that case) you'll be looking for mineral acids at this point. If you are in DSO galaxy then WY-1444 is probably the easiest place to find them. Look for the acid pools biome and scan with your organic harvesting tool of choice to see if there are any.
