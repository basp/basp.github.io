Update: this was originally called the AI opionated newbie guide but since the old AI corp has transformed into Opes Sanctuary (OS) I'm changing the title.

Welcome to Wayfar 1444. This guide is here to help you get started playing the game but keep in mind that this is an _opinionated_ guide. That being said, it will set you upon the path of being self sufficient which is one of the primary goals.

Note one: this guide is meant as a companion guide to [Averitti's excellent writings](https://sites.google.com/site/accordingtomariah/change-the-banner). In fact, before you read even further I recommend you read her stuff first; it's much more awesome and also has a lot of informational screenshots. 

Note two: this an opionated guide so it will be full of statements that might not really be true after all. Keep in mind though: _do experiment_ outside the boundaries of whatever is said below whenever you feel comfortable.

Note three: commands you can type are `represented like this` (don't type that, it won't work). You can `help commands` to get a basic overview of what is possible. Also you can `help` to get an index on stuff you can `help thingy` on. For example, from that list, `help newbie` works too and is very useful. 

Note four: If you see `Vanity` or `Rayne` online. Feel free to page them for any questions you might have. Check their __idle__ status though.

### About Wayfar1444
Wayfar1444 is a MOO that is built upon the [hellcore](http://hellmoo.org/wiki/index.php/HellCore). It's the only playable game I know of that has been built on it. In fact, this game and hellcore are tied together in more than one way.

Let's not get into that now though, you are not here to read about the history of Wayfar1444. That can wait. The rest of this guide will explain how to go from a <del>lowly newbie</del> welcomed new player to a <del>pro</del> reasonably self sufficient Wayfar1444 player that knows his or her way around... Somewhat.

### Communication
Turn `chatnet on`. Now you can `chat you message here` with other players. You can view a history of the chat by typing `chatnet history`.

You can view all the players that are currently connected by typing `who`. This will show up a list with everyone and the thing they are doing. Take note of the __Idle__ column as this is useful information to determine whether your communications with this person will be effective.

You can also directly `page someplayer your message here`. If you really need some attention, `page vanity Hiya!`. Please don't harras a player. Some people might be very busy or some might have a hard time with processing all incoming information that the game is outputting due to whatever reason (they might just be drunk).

If you get no response, don't spam but try at another time with other players online. If someone is able to help you and sees your message you will most likely get some help. Also feel free to page players if you see them doing something interesting that might be useful to you (like harvesting with some unknown apparatus). 

Remember though upon who you call. Not all might have good intentions.

#### Corpnet
If you are in a corp you can use `corp your message here` to chat too. You can chat with your buddies this way but I'm sure they have told you at this point.

### Starting out for the first time
Starting out for the first time is a little bit different because more mechanics need to be explained. If you are completely new, start here. Otherwise, just skip whatever you deem not interesting.

When you just start out (or after a reroll, more on that later) you will find yourself in a shuttle with the game suggesting you to get out of it sooner than later. Just follow the instructions and go `out` of the shuttle and you'll find yourself at the commerce main junction way at the alpha complex. There's some shops and other facilities around but if you are eager to really get started you probably want to head `east` to the complex-alpha mall lobby.

At this point the game may or may not give you some hints about terminals you see here. Before you can use any of them you will have to set both your `@gender` and `background` though. Also, take a moment to `@describe me as your description here` to set a custom description. It doesn't have to be an essay - even a single line is better than nothing.

The colony dispatch terminal is used if you want to start a new colony or if you don't have a beacon setup. The link-up terminal can be used if you, or somebody you want to join up with has a beacon setup and active at his or her colony. Take a moment to exam the terminals and use the one that is appropriate for your situation (it will probably be the dispatch terminal for most new players). No matter what terminal you use, you'll eventually end up in a drop pod falling towards a planet. 

#### Backgrounds
Before you can set out, the game requires you to choose a background. There is really no right or wrong choice here so I recommend you take the one that seems the most fun and compatible with the things you would like to do.

If you really have no clue I recommend going for the ranger (or botanist perhaps). These are very straightforward to complete for new players as they only depend on you having a few skills. You do have a bit more control with the ranger background on __when__ you want to finish it but it gives you one less reroll point. 

If you go with botanist you get to `explore` and `discover` a lot which also will add to your blueprint chip collection (more on that later, just collect these for now and store them somewhere safe). Note that exploring can take a while if you are just starting out. Also, some backgrounds involve jobs that include wait times (both ranger and botanist have these). 

### Setting up
After you dispatched to a planet or linked up with an existing colony, you'll find yourself with a basic set of harvesting and crafting equipment. Also you get some other helpfull items such as the datapad and handbook. Take a moment to look through your `inventory` and `examine` everything to find out what actions (commands) it supports.

Afer this check out your crafting tools (probably on the basic crafting tool) and do a `list basic` to see what things it can craft. One of these is a _pre-fab shelter kit_ which you should make as soon as possible. Before you do though, try to find a nice spot. Ideally, it has a nice long room description signalling the abundance of a lot of resources.

Also, you want to setup near a spot that has a good variety of biomes nearby. When starting out, you really want a planet that has a plenty of forest, jungle, mountains and desert. Eventually you'll need to harvest in other biomes too if you have the aforementioned biomes on your planet (and preferably nearby) you'll be in a good position to craft everything you need to get spaceborn. Note that you can also use the `map` command to check out various aspects of your surroundings. The command itself will explain about its various options but the `map biome` one is the more useful.

### Skills
Before you start exploring for a good spot, take a note of your `status` and `skills` and note the amount of skillpoints available. You could probably learn some skills right now. You can use the `skill` command to browse the available skill groups and also to view skills in each group and see what they do. The skill system in Wayfar1444 is very friendly and facilitates trying different skills and combinations out. If you `learn` a skill you are not satisfied with or if you just want to try out something else you can always `forget` a skill and get 75% of your skillpoints back. 

This also means you don't have to create an army of alts to try out various things as you can often easily flip your complete build around on your main faster than you can setup a new character. The reason for this is that you get skillpoints by using skills. So the more skills you have, the faster you will get skillpoints. This means that on a developed character it's usually not a big problem to regain any skillpoints lost forgetting skills.

### Crafting
Note: this section is about manual crafting, automated crafting and factories is explained a bit further down.

Sooner or later you probably have to do some crafting. Even if you are more combat oriented and don't care about crafting much you most likely will not be able to avoid it. If you are reading this and just starting out then you probably don't have much crafting tools. So after you found a decent place to settle you probably want to craft some additional crafting tools. Fortunately you are given a basic crafting tool and you can use this to _bootstrap_ yourself. The structure crafting tool and equipment crafting tool are probably the most useful at this point.

Especially in the beginning but even when you are more experienced you will run into requirements for recipes that you probably don't know how to craft. Luckily, the game also provides you with a __colonial assembly datapad__. You can use this to `lookup thing with datapad` and if the datapad knows about it it will tell you what tool to use to make it. 

Pro tip: use generic queries with the datapad and don't try to be overly specific. For example, if you need _adaptive-phase fabric_ don't `lookup adaptive-phase fabric with datapad` but `lookup fabric with datapad` instead. Or even just `lookup fab with datapad`. Your chance of success will be much higher and with luck you will also find out about some other interesting stuff you can make.

Besides regular crafting using the blueprints on a tool you can also `improvise` things if you have the __improvisation__ skill. There are two ways to improvise. You can just type `improvise` and you'll be presented with a menu of all the things in your inventory that can be used for improvisation. After selecting one of the items you get another menu of all the things you can craft with it. The second way to improvise is to `improvise something with tool`. A few of the crafting tools can be used for improvisation and you can `improvise with tool` to get a list of all the things you can improvise with said tool.

### Pointers
* Love the datapad that you are given; you an "lookup <thing> with datapad" and it will tell you how/what tool you need to make it.

* Build shipping containers and use them to organize your things; shipping containers are only 8 inert metal (which you can find almost everywhere). Also, you label them for convenience.

* Craft the advanced structure tool. You will need this to create better buildings.

* Craft a ranch, your new home; only noobs live in a prefab starter house.

* Setup a lab so you can build the advanced equipment workstation.

* Get better harvesting tools, this will save you a lot of time.  

* Build a starship complex; you'll need this to get spaceborn.

* Get spaceborne; getting spaceborne is arguably easier than getting airborne. Flying around in starships is fun and kinda important so you better get this down as soon as possible.

* Learn how to navigate around the Wayfar space; sometimes it's a bit tricky when there are planets that have the same name as their system. You'll eventually learn to visualize it in your head though.

* Find the nearest moon with metallic moon biome; metallic moon biome is quite rare but most moons have at least a small percentage of it. You will need this biome to find fullerene which is required for more awesome equipment. Also look for ceramic geode and some other thing I can't remember. Just look around for exotic stuf.

* Mine gas clouds; you will eventually need stuff like prolium gas for fancy equipment. Can craft an asteroid miner, a gas mining module and fly to the nearest asteroid belt. Scan the various gas clouds until you find one that contains prolium gas and mine it.

* Once you found prolium, you can craft a better EVA suit. Turn that old padded one into a chemical resistant or insulated EVA suit and/or craft yourself a sweet pneumatic exosuit.

* Chances are you'll be looking for mineral acids at some point. Probably to craft some sweet explosive units. If you are in DSO galaxy then WY-1444 is probably the easiest place to find them. Look for the acid pools biome and scan with your organic harvesting tool of choice to see if there are any.
