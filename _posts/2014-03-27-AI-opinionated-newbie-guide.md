# Opionionated AI corp newbie guide
Welcome to Wayfar 1444. This guide is here to help you get started playing the game but keep in mind that this is an _opinionanted_ guide. That being said, it will set you upon the path of being self sufficient which is one of the primary goals.

## About Wayfar1444
Wayfar1444 is a MOO that is built upon HellCore. It's the only playable game I know of that has been built on hellcore. In fact, this game and hellcore are tied togehter in more than one way on more than one level.

You are not hare to read about the history of Wayfar1444 though. That can wait. The rest of this guide will explain how to go from a lowly newbie to a pro Wayfar1444 player.

## Starting out for the first time
Starting out for the first time is a little bit different because more mechanics need to be explained. If you are completely new, start here.

	rusting bucket seats in the back of a cheap shuttle
	This squalid shuttle barely made the trip down from the sweltering star liner. The sooner you leave, the better. You can do so by typing: OUT.

The game will explain most of the actions at this point so just play along.

	> out
	You walk out.

	commerce main junctionway [3, 3, 2]
	The junctionway hums with passing traffic.  Travel zones lead north and south to the outfitting and sales 
	district.
	  Complex technician and a medical dog (dw-17523) are standing here.
	You see a shuttle terminal and an economic loan terminal here.
	[ Exits: north east south west in ]
	Complex technician [to Rayne]: Oh! Hello, I didn't see you there.

The game might give you a hint to add a description. It might also direct you to the next target. Feel free to follow anything the game says for fun and profit but for the guide you should go east and check out the colony dispatch terminal.

## TODO
* Learn the primitive assembly skills (these are useful for almost all builds, especially when starting out)

* Love the datapad that you are given; you an "lookup <thing> with datapad" and it will tell you how/what tool you need to make it

* Build shipping containers and use them to organize your things; shipping containers are only 8 inert metal (which you can find almost everywhere with

* Craft the advanced structure tool. You will need this to create better buildings.

* Craft a ranch, your new home; only noobs live in a prefab starter house.

* Get good tools: q-osmose for energy, slimfast for organic and massed for minerals; You can buy the slimfast intake component from the central complex using the terminal in your ranch.

* Build a starship complex; you'll need this to get spaceborn.

* Get spaceborne; getting spaceborn is arguably easier than getting airborn. Flying around in starships is important so you better get this down as soon as possible.

* Learn how to navigate around the Wayfar space; sometimes it's a bit tricky when there are planets that have the same name as their system. You'll eventually learn to visualize it in your head though.

* Mine gas clouds; you will eventually need stuff like prolium gas for fancy equipment. This is not usually easily obtainable on plantes. Once you get spaceborne and comfortable with flying around, you can craft an asteroid miner. Craft a gas mining module and you can fly to the nearest asteroid belt and try to find some gas clouds. Check them all until you find prolium.

* Find the nearest moon with metallic moon biome; metallic moon biome is quite rare but most moons have at least a small percentage of it. You will need this biome to find fullerene which is required for more awesome equipment. Also look for ceramic geode and some other thing I can't remember. Just look around for exotic stuf.

* Chances are (unless you are already on Wayfar, and this guide will suck for you in that case) you'll be looking for mineral acids at this point. If you are in DSO galaxy then WY-1444 is probably the easiest place to find them. Look for the acid pools biome and scan with your organic harvesting tool of choice to see if there are any.
