Update: this was originally called the AI opionated newbie guide but since the old AI corp has transformed into Opes Sanctuary (OS) I'm changing the title.

Welcome to Wayfar 1444. This guide is here to help you get started playing the game but keep in mind that this is an _opinionated_ guide. That being said, it will set you upon the path of being self sufficient which is one of the primary goals.

Note one: this guide is meant as a companion guide to [Averitti's excellent writings](https://sites.google.com/site/accordingtomariah/change-the-banner). In fact, before you read even further I recommend you read her stuff first; it's much more awesome and also has a lot of informational screenshots. 

Note two: this an opionated guide so it will be full of statements that might not really be true after all. Keep in mind though: _do experiment_ outside the boundaries of whatever is said below whenever you feel comfortable.

Note three: commands you can type are `represented like this` (don't type that, it won't work). You can `help commands` to get a basic overview of what is possible. Also you can `help` to get an index on stuff you can `help thingy` on. For example, from that list, `help newbie` works too and is very useful. 

Note four: If you see `Vanity` or `Rayne` online. Feel free to page them for any questions you might have. Check their __idle__ status though.

### About Wayfar1444
Wayfar1444 is a MOO that is built upon the [hellcore](http://hellmoo.org/wiki/index.php/HellCore). It's the only playable game I know of that has been built on it. In fact, this game and hellcore are tied together in more than one way.

Let's not get into that now though, you are not here to read about the history of Wayfar1444. That can wait. The rest of this guide will explain how to go from a <del>lowly newbie</del> welcomed new player to a <del>pro</del> reasonably self sufficient Wayfar1444 player that knows his or her way around... Somewhat.

### Communication
Turn `chatnet on`. Now you can `chat you message here` with other players. You can view a history of the chat by typing `chatnet history`.

You can view all the players that are currently connected by typing `who`. This will show up a list with everyone and the thing they are doing. Take note of the __Idle__ column as this is useful information to determine whether your communications with this person will be effective.

You can also directly `page someplayer your message here`. If you really need some attention, `page vanity Hiya!`. Please don't harras a player. Some people might be very busy or some might have a hard time with processing all incoming information that the game is outputting due to whatever reason (they might just be drunk).

If you get no response, don't spam but try at another time with other players online. If someone is able to help you and sees your message you will most likely get some help.  

#### Corpnet
If you are in a corp you can use `corp your message here` to chat too. You can chat with your buddies this way but I'm sure they have told you about this already if you are in a corp.

### Starting out for the first time
Starting out for the first time is a little bit different because more mechanics need to be explained. If you are completely new, start here. Otherwise, just skip whatever you deem not interesting.

When you just start out (or after a reroll, more on that later) you will find yourself in a shuttle with the game suggesting you to get out. This is a good suggestion so just follow the instructions and go `out` of the shuttle. You'll end up at the commerce main junction way at the alpha complex. There's some shops and other facilities around but if you are eager to really get started you probably want to head `east` to the complex-alpha mall lobby.

At this point the game may or may not give you some hints about terminals you see here. Before you can use any of them you will have to set both your `@gender` and `background` though. Also, take a moment to `@describe me as your description here` to set a custom description. It doesn't have to be an essay - even a single line is better than nothing.

The colony dispatch terminal is used if you want to start a new colony or if you don't have a beacon setup. The link-up terminal can be used if you, or somebody you want to join up with has a beacon setup and active at his or her colony. Take a moment to exam the terminals and use the one that is appropriate for your situation (it will probably be the dispatch terminal for most new players). No matter what terminal you use, you'll eventually end up in a drop pod falling towards a planet. 

#### Backgrounds
Before you can set out, the game requires you to choose a background. There is really no right or wrong choice here so I recommend you take the one that seems the most fun and compatible with the things you would like to do.

If you really have no clue I recommend going for the ranger (or botanist perhaps). These are very straightforward to complete for new players as they only depend on you having a few skills. You do have a bit more control with the ranger background on __when__ you want to finish it but it gives you one less reroll point. 

If you go with botanist you get to `explore` and `discover` a lot which also will add to your blueprint chip collection (more on that later, just collect these for now and store them somewhere safe). Additionally, you will probably find stuff that you need to research or hack. Store these somewhere safe too as they will be useful later when you are doing the lab technician or hacker backgrounds. 

Note that some backgrounds involve jobs that include wait times (both ranger and botanist have these). 

### Setting up
After you dispatched to a planet or linked up with an existing colony, you'll find yourself with a basic set of harvesting and crafting equipment. Also you get some other helpfull items such as the datapad and handbook. Take a moment to look through your `inventory` and `examine` everything to find out what actions (commands) it supports.

Afer this check out your crafting tools (probably on the basic crafting tool) and do a `list basic` to see what things it can craft. One of these is a _pre-fab shelter kit_ which you should make as soon as possible. Before you do though, try to find a nice spot. Ideally, it has a nice long room description signalling the abundance of a lot of resources but this is not essential.

You _do_ want to setup near a spot that has a good variety of biomes nearby. When starting out, you probably want to be on a planet that has a __forest__, __jungle__, __mountains__ and __desert__ and a spot that has those biomes nearby. Eventually you'll need to harvest in other biomes too but that can wait. If you have the aforementioned biomes on your planet (and preferably nearby) you'll be in a good position to craft everything you need to get spaceborn. 

Note that you can also use the `map` command to check out various aspects of your surroundings. The command itself will explain about its various options but the `map biome` one is the more useful.

### Skills
Before you start exploring for a good spot, check your `status` and `skills` and note the amount of skillpoints available. You could probably learn some skills right now. You can use the `skill` command to browse the available skill groups and also to view skills in each group and see what they do. The skill system in Wayfar1444 is very friendly and facilitates trying different skills and combinations out. If you `learn` a skill and you are not satisfied with it or if you just want to try out something else, you can always `forget` a skill and get 75% of your skillpoints back. 

This also means you don't have to create an army of alts to try out various things as you can often easily flip your complete build around on your main faster than you can setup a new character. The reason for this is that you get skillpoints by using skills. So the more skills you have, the faster you will get skillpoints. This means that on a developed character it's usually not a big problem to regain the skillpoints that were lost.

### Crafting
Note: this section is about manual crafting, automated crafting and factories is explained a bit further down.

Sooner or later you probably have to do some crafting. Even if you are more combat oriented and don't care about crafting much you most likely will not be able to avoid it. If you are just starting out then you probably don't have much crafting tools. So after you found a decent place to settle you probably want to craft some additional crafting tools. Fortunately you are given a basic crafting tool and you can use this to _bootstrap_ yourself. The structure crafting tool and equipment crafting tool are probably the most useful at this point.

Especially in the beginning, you will often run into recipes with unfamiliar requirements that you don't know (or can't remember) how to craft. Luckily, the game also provides you with a __colonial assembly datapad__. You can use this to `lookup thing with datapad` and if the datapad knows about it it will tell you what tool to use to make it. 

__Pro tip__: use generic queries with the datapad and don't try to be overly specific. For example, if you need _adaptive-phase fabric_ don't `lookup adaptive-phase fabric with datapad` but `lookup fabric with datapad` instead. Or even just `lookup fab with datapad`. Your chance of success will be much higher and with luck you will also find out about some other interesting stuff you can make.

As awesome as the datapad is, it has its limitations. There are blueprints that are not on the crafting tools by default but these have to be found in game. They usually contain pretty interesting things and some of them are highly desirable. The things you can make with blueprints that are found in the game world usually don't appear on the datapad. Also some of the things that you can `improvise` also doesn't appear and has to be found out by experimentation.

Besides regular crafting using the blueprints on a tool you can also `improvise` things if you have the __improvisation__ skill. There are two ways to improvise. You can just type `improvise` and you'll be presented with a menu of all the things in your inventory that can be used for improvisation. After selecting one of the items you get another menu of all the things you can craft with it. The second way to improvise is to `improvise something with tool`. A few of the crafting tools can be used for improvisation and you can `improvise with tool` to get a list of all the things you can improvise with said tool.

### Refineries
The resources you harvest will have varying levels of quality. Some will be of good quality and others will be of very low quality. Each resource has an inherent quality potential but the actual quality of the resource will often be lower. 

If you want to craft high quality items you need high quality resources too. Refining is the process of creating over-maxed quality resources from a bunch of crappy lower quality resources. There are three buildings involved with refining raw resources: the refinery for minerals, the organic processing plant for, well, organic stuff and the nuclear enrichment plant for energy.

The way refining works is that you `mass-add` lots of raw resources of varying quality to a refining processor (each refining building uses a different kind but they all work the same). Then when you `process` the raw resources you will get back refined resources that are a little bit over max quality. When you look at a refining processor you will notice a line saying the amount of material quality equivalent. This is the sum of the quality of all raw resources added to the processor and it determines the amount of refined resources you will get back.

For example, assume you have one hundred inert metals of 5 quality. The material quality equivalent will be 500 (100 * 5). When you process the raw inert metal you will get back individual pieces of 33 quality. So with a material quality equivalent of 500 this means we have the equivalent of 500 / 33 = 15 + 5 / 33 pieces of refined inert metal. Because the processor cannot make a 5 / 33 piece of inert metal, 5 material quality equivalent will remain.

When you refine resources, the furnace (or reactor or resequencer) will be configured to that resource. You cannot refine other resources on it until you `reset` it. When you reset a processor that still has a bit of material quality equivalent left the game will ask you if you are sure about this as it will destroy the material inside. This might lead you to believe that you need to first get everything out from the processor before you can `mass-add` new stuff to it but this is not true. The warning only applies for any raw material that might be left (usually a bit of raw material equivalent left over from a previous resource). Any already refined resources in the processor will be completely safe. This means that you can focus on harvesting raw resources and refining then without having to worry with getting all the refined stuff out everytime you need to reset the furnace. 

### Starships
Eventually you probably want to get into space and explore further. There are various ways to get yourself a starship: you could craft one, you could buy one or you could steal one perhaps. If you are just starting out I strongly recommend the first option: building the ship yourself. For this you will need a starship complex. Even if you can use somebody else's complex it's probably a good idea to set one up yourself too. Don't forget to `configure` it to __private__ so only authorized people can land at it. 

Believe me, you don't want a raiding party swooping down on your starship complex to blow it up and chop up all the ships you have in there.

Also, if you land at a starship complex that you are authorized on, you can `load starship into starship complex` to store it. If you leave it outside it will be much easier target for any hackers that might stumble upon your compound.

#### Warning
Make sure you really trust the controller (owner) of the starship complex if you decide to `load` your ship in there. If the owner decides to transfer control of the building to somebody else (or to the corp) then all ships inside will be transfered too. 

So, don't be like me and move your personal fleet out of your complex before you transfer it to somebody else. The same thing is true for vehicles and garages and hangars. In fact, all transferable stuff inside the building will be transfered including any droids and what not.

### Rerolling
TODO

### Pointers
* Love the datapad that you are given; you can `lookup something with datapad` and it will tell you how/what tool you need to make it; use generic queries, don't `lookup adaptive-phase fabric with datapad` but just `lookup fab with datapad` instead.

* Build shipping containers and use them to organize your things; shipping containers require only 8 inert metal (and you can find this almost everywhere) and can be conveniently labeled to keep them apart if you have multiple in a single room.

* Craft the advanced structure tool, you will need this to create better buildings. For example the ranch. 

* Craft a ranch. Only scrubs live in a prefab starter house. Build the shelter for the quick skillpoints and build a real house as soon as possible.

* Setup a lab so you can build the advanced equipment workstation this will also provide you with a place where you can research artifacts.

* Get better harvesting tools, this will save you a lot of time.  

* Build a starship complex, you'll need this to get spaceborn.

* Get to space, which is arguably easier than flying around on the surface. Piloting starships is fun and kinda important so you better get this down as soon as possible.

* Craft an EVA suit. A padded EVA suit is a good starter suit and it's conveniently also a component for the chemical resistant and insulated EVA suits (which you probably wanna craft later after you found prolium).

* Learn how to navigate around the Wayfar space, sometimes it's a bit tricky when there are planets that have the same name as their system. You'll eventually learn to visualize it in your head though.

* Find the nearest moon with metallic moon biome. Metallic moon biome is quite rare but most moons have at least a small percentage of it. You will need this biome to find fullerene which is required for more awesome equipment. Also look for ceramic geode and some other thing I can't remember. Just look around for exotic stuf.

* Mine gas clouds. You will eventually need stuff like prolium gas for fancy equipment. So craft an asteroid miner and a gas mining module (don't forget to install it) and fly to the nearest asteroid belt. Scan the various gas clouds until you find one that contains prolium gas and mine it.

* Once you found prolium, you can craft a better EVA suit. Turn that old padded one into a chemical resistant or insulated EVA suit and/or craft yourself a sweet pneumatic exosuit.

* Chances are you'll be looking for mineral acids at some point. Probably to craft some sweet explosive units. If you are in DSO galaxy then WY-1444 is probably the easiest place to find them. Look for the acid pools biome and scan with your organic harvesting tool of choice to see if there are any.
