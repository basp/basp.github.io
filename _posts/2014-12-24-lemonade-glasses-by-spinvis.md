Oh, if you could be here, today
My strange friend
And that you would be sober... 
And that you would've shaven yourself

How would you laugh at my shirt
And my house, and my old head
I would ask you how it is
And I would not have believed you

It was a good time
If I'm not mistaken
We were so right, always
But alas, we didn't say anything

You realized it earlier than me.
There is so little timee-ayaya-hey

You looked pretty sweet
You acted like someone on TV
How could I be that way? 
Not I, not with that hair of mine

A circle on your arm? 
Not me...
Because I was much too scaaa-ahaha-rered

She had the right name
She had, the right skin
She was wearing something fabulous
And you too, looked awesome

She lived in Madrid
She had, a very decent jooooo-oooo-oooob

I watched a movie that night
I think on channel 2
Something about a war hero
There was not much talking

You first saw him as a child
But it could've been the commercials
Then the telephone went
And so I just left

I even had a real tear
The ash got it my eye too
She wore a poncho, that day, if I'm not mistaken
How would you laugh, about that guy
With his cake
And his "wrong" tune

But I will tell you, there will be a time
For sure
That he may do it another time
