### Disclaimer
This post is about ```if``` __statements__. Those things that don't yield a result but just do __something__ or __some other thing__. They are the tell of a side-effect. And side-effects suck so ```if```` statements suck as well.

In fact, statements tend to suck in general because they don't have a value. What the fuck are they doing just being void? I'm quite sure something happened you damn __statement__ but you __refuse to tell__!

If you like statements and especially ```if``` statements you better stop reading.
