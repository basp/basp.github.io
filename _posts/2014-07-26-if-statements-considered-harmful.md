### Disclaimer
This post is about ```if``` __statements__. Those things that don't yield a result but just do __something__ or __some other thing__. They are the tell of a side-effect. And side-effects suck so ```if``` statements suck as well.

In fact, statements tend to suck in general because they don't have a value. What the fuck are they doing just being void? I'm quite sure something happened you damn __statement__ but you __refuse to tell__!

If you like statements and especially ```if``` statements you better stop reading.

### Statements
Statements suck gigantic arse. I'm not quite sure who invented that shit but he or she should be retroactively be stoned in punishement (I'm being overly dramatic here, note that I'm not actually being serious about stoning the poor sod). Why are statements so bad? Well, they don't tell you shit for starters.

#### They Are Void
You know what ```void``` is? Nothing. All statements return conceptual ```void``` by definition so they are bascially just expressions that have no result. This means they are crappy expressions because they actually have no clue what they are doing. They _jsut do something_ and then say "I'm done, good luck, I'm outta here.".
