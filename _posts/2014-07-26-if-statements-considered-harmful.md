### Disclaimer
This post is about ```if``` __statements__. Those things that don't yield a result but just do __something__ or __some other thing__. They are the tell of a side-effect. And side-effects suck so ```if``` statements suck as well.

In fact, statements tend to suck in general because they don't have a value. What the fuck are they doing just being void? I'm quite sure something happened you damn __statement__ but you __refuse to tell__!

If you like statements and especially ```if``` statements you better stop reading.

### Statements
Statements suck gigantic arse. Why? Well, they don't tell you shit for starters. A  statement is like that coworker who doesn't respond but in the end complies with your request or gives a personal spin to it without any feedback. It nods but you have no clue what the fuck is gonna happen.

#### They Are Void
You know what ```void``` is? Nothing. All statements return conceptual ```void``` by definition so they are bascially just expressions that have no result. This means they are crappy expressions because they actually have no clue what they are doing. They _jsut do something_ and then say "I'm done, good luck, I'm outta here.".
