# Life & Complexity
When embracing life in it's whole with all it's aspects, or any subset of it, one should always embrace complexity too. The reality we live in is getting more complex every instant we experience and even now we can observe it prevail over simplicity. If you are not careful it's easy to believe things are getting simpler or easier and in many cases individual things indeed do get "easier" as in taking less energy for the average person to obtain.

# Entropy
At this point the author has to conceed he is not much of a thermal dynamics expert nor possibly aware from all the other fields that deal with a concept known as _entropy_. It's a big word but in this case I'm referring to the amount of _randomness_ there is in any kind of system ([entropy: order and disorder)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(order_and_disorder).

As a sidenote, if you really look at how entropy is used (even though it might have a special definition) in other systems you will notice it will always have to do with the amount of _disorder_ there is a system. How a particular form of _disorder_ is defined is usually a parameter of the field in which the concept of entropy is used.

# Disorder
I've talked a bit
