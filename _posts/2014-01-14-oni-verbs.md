At this point `Oni` can do quite a lot. If we use the `oni_test_world` module we get two `player` objects named `Wizard` and `Mistress` that we can login to. I recommend `Mistress` as `Wizard` is more of a control character not for fooling around. First, compile `Oni`:

    PS> .\make.ps1

And then startup the Erlang shell:

    PS> werl -pa ebin

Optionally, at the Erlang shell prompt execute `oni:test()` (not much tests for now):

    Erlang R16B02 (erts-5.10.3) [smp:4:4] [async-threads:10]

    Eshell V5.10.3  (abort with ^G)
    1> oni:test().
      All 11 tests passed.
    ok
    2>

And then the `oni:start` function:

    2> oni:start().
    ok
    3> 

Now initialize `oni_test_world` with the following:

    3> oni_test_world:create().
    true
    4> 

This will create small number of objects but at this point you can connect with your telnet client and take over from there. Start up your favorite client and connect to `127.0.0.1:7777` (you can change the port):

    
    Oni [lum invader]
    Invalid player or password

Note that my client (Mudlet) is sending some stuff that `Oni` doesn't recognize yet. Hence the `Invalid player or password` output. At this point you can login with either `Wizard` or `Mistress` with the following:

    > connect Mistress
    *** connected (Mistress) ***

You have both the `wizard` and `programmer` flags so you can basically do everything.
