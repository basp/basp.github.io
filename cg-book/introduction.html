<root><section><h1>Introduction</h1><p>This book is mostly written for myself as I'm going through the excellent <strong>Computer Graphics, Fall 2009</strong> series which can be found on YouTube. Hopefully my notes will be useful to somebody else as well.</p><h3>Vector space</h3><p>In a <strong>vector</strong> space you have two operations. You can add two vectors <mathjax>$\vec{u}$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$\vec{v}$</mathjax> to get a new vector.</p><p><mathjax>$$\vec{w} = \vec{u} + \vec{v}\\$$</mathjax></p><p>Or you can scale a vector <mathjax>$\vec{v}$</mathjax> with a constant <mathjax>$c$</mathjax> to create a longer or shorter version, or even one in the opposite direction if your <em>scalar</em> <mathjax>$c$</mathjax> is negative.</p><p><mathjax>$$\vec{u} = c\vec{v}$$</mathjax></p><p>In computer graphics, we use vectors all the time as directions.</p><p>A <em>frame</em> is a self-contained vector space. We use frames to move sets of vectors and <em>points</em> around. Every vector or point is always in reference to a frame. The default frame is the <em>world</em> frame.</p><p>A three-dimensional frame is made up of an <em>origin</em> point as well as three vectors pointing in the direction of the <mathjax>$x$</mathjax>, <mathjax>$y$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$z$</mathjax> axes. Similarly, a two-dimensional frame will have the origin point but only two vectors pointing along the <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$y$</mathjax> axes.</p><p>When we are moving frames around in space we need to keep track of that origin. So in addition to vectors, we also deal with points.</p><aside><p>Structurally, vectors and points are very much the same. On a very low level, the two-dimensional vector <mathjax>$\vec{v}$</mathjax> might be indistinguishable from a two-dimensional point <mathjax>$P$</mathjax> if the <mathjax>$x$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$y$</mathjax> components are the same.</p><p>In fact, some graphics frameworks or engines use the same <em>data structure</em> for both points and vectors and this is usually not a huge problem in practice. However, it is good to keep in mind that <em>conceptually</em> vectors and points are not the same at all.</p><p>When thinking about a problem or trying to do the math it is a good idea to keep vectors and points distinct. It is probably fine to use the same data structure when implementing them in code though as long as you know what you're doing.</p><p>However, if you're not sure about implementation, keep them separate since they tend to serve very different purposes and it is much easier to reason about them if they are treated that way.</p></aside><p>There is a few things we can do with points and vectors. We can take a point and add a vector to get another point.</p><p><mathjax>$$Q = P + \vec{v}$$</mathjax></p><p>Similarly, we can get a vector by subtracting two points.</p><p><mathjax>$$\vec{v} = Q - P$$</mathjax></p><p>If we have two points <mathjax>$P_1$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$P_2$</mathjax> we can imagine a line between them. We can get on any point of that line by first getting the vector <mathjax>$\vec{v}$</mathjax> between those points.</p><p><mathjax>$$\vec{v} = P_2 - P_1$$</mathjax></p><p>And then <em>scaling</em> the vector <mathjax>$\vec{v}$</mathjax> with a value <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> where</p><p><mathjax>$$0 &lt;= \alpha &lt;= 1$$</mathjax></p><p>and <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> represents the distance from point <mathjax>$P_1$</mathjax> on the line between <mathjax>$P_1$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$P_2$</mathjax>.</p><p><mathjax>$$\vec{v_{\alpha}} = \alpha\vec{v}$$</mathjax></p><p>Finally, by adding the vector <mathjax>$\vec{v_{\alpha}}$</mathjax> to point <mathjax>$P_1$</mathjax> we arrive on a point <mathjax>$P_{\alpha}$</mathjax> that is <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> units on the line between <mathjax>$P_1$</mathjax> and <mathjax>$P_2$</mathjax>.</p><p><mathjax>$$P_{\alpha} = P_1 + \vec{v_{\alpha}}$$</mathjax></p><p>In practice, we often use <mathjax>$t$</mathjax> instead of <mathjax>$\alpha$</mathjax> so if write that out using <mathjax>$t$</mathjax> we get</p><p><mathjax>$$\begin{align}
P_t &amp;= P_1 + t(P_2 - P_1)\\
    &amp;= (1 - t)P_1 + tP_2
\end{align}$$</mathjax></p><p>with the last form being the one that is most commonly used in practice. This equasion is exactly the same as what is known as <em>linear interpolation</em>.</p><aside><p>The linear interpolation operation, also known as <code>lerp</code> is an operation that frequently crops in all kinds of algorithms. It's the most basic of interpolation methods and just follows a straight line between two known <em>quantities</em>.</p><p>The code to implement this operation mirrors the math from above exactly.</p><pre><code class="cs"><p>float Lerp1(float v0, float v1, float t) =&gt;<br/>    v0 + t * (v1 - v0);</p><p>float Lerp2(float v0, float v1, float t) =&gt;<br/>    (1 - t) * v0 + t * v1;</p></code></pre></aside><p>We don't care about the <em>dimension</em> of the points and vectors we are using. We assume that they are all of the <strong>same</strong> dimension but we do not really care whether they are two-dimensional, three-dimensional or <mathjax>$n$</mathjax>-dimensional.</p><h3>Affine combinations</h3><p>If we have a combination of points such as</p><p><mathjax>$$P = \alpha_1{P_1} + \alpha_2{P_2} + \alpha_3{P_3}$$</mathjax></p><p>where</p><p><mathjax>$$\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 = 1$$</mathjax></p><p>Then we can call that an <em>affine combination</em>. The vectors plus the points are called an <em>affine space</em>. Affine combinations and affine spaces are essential to how we eventually combine everything in space.</p><aside>Note that the linear interpolation equation from the previous section is also an affine combination since <mathjax>$1 - t + t = 1$</mathjax>.</aside></section></root>
