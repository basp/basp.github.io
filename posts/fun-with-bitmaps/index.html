</div>


    <br> <div class="text-justify">

<p>Weekend is here so let&rsquo;s have some fun with bitmaps. Before we can start though, we need to grab a bitmap or two to work with. Make sure to get one or two good sized ones (around 1000x1000 will do) and make sure to put them in an easy path.</p>

<p>Oh, and of course I&rsquo;m doing this from <strong>LINQPad</strong> so that&rsquo;s where the <code>Dump</code> method comes from. If you don&rsquo;t have LINQPad you can still follow along but you <em>will</em> have to do some extra work to actually view the results.</p>

<h3 id="loading-a-bitmap">loading a bitmap</h3>

<p>One of the base classes for <code>Bitmap</code> is <code>Image</code> and in fact, when we call <code>Bitmap.FromFile</code> we actually get an <code>Image</code> instance. We could probably cast it but I resorted to:</p>

<pre><code>const path = @&quot;some/path/to/image&quot;;
var img = Image.FromFile(path);
var src = new Bitmap(img);
src.Dump();
</code></pre>

<p>We need a <code>Bitmap</code> otherwise we don&rsquo;t have access to the <code>GetPixel</code> and <code>SetPixel</code> methods.</p>

<p>Note that you can just <code>Dump</code> the bitmap and LINQPad will render it for you in the output. If you don&rsquo;t have LINQPad it&rsquo;s probably easiest to just write the bitmap back to disk and use an external viewer. <strong>Make sure to use a different path</strong> because you don&rsquo;t want to overwrite your original image!</p>

<pre><code>src.Save(@&quot;some/path/to/image&quot;);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="what-s-a-bitmap">what&rsquo;s a bitmap?</h3>

<p>We can consider the bitmap as a 3D dimensional array. The <em>dimension</em> of the <code>x</code> axis is the <strong>width</strong> of the image. The dimension of the <code>y</code> axis is the <strong>height</strong> of the image. And the dimension of the <code>z</code> axis hold the color data. We&rsquo;re mostly going to use the  <strong>RGB</strong> color model because it&rsquo;s widely used and easy to understand from a programmer perspective.</p>

<h3 id="colors">colors</h3>

<p>If you ever took a painting class, you know that we can represent any color using a combination of red green and blue. If you look at your screen with a magnification tool you can probably seen these <strong>subpixels</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Representing a color as a red, green and blue, or <strong>RGB</strong> value is easy on the computer and not that hard to understand as well so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna use. Be aware though that there are different ways to look at the color spectrum and it&rsquo;s quite a deep and interesting subject to research.</p>

<p>Nowdays you will often actually work with the <strong>ARGB</strong> model which has an extra channel to hold the <em>alpha</em> (opaque/transparant) value but we won&rsquo;t bother too much with that. Once you understand RGB you can easily work with ARGB as well as the principles are completely the same.</p>

<h3 id="a-basic-filter">a basic filter</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s implement a filter. A good starting point is to convert the image using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_luminance">relative luminance</a> map. The formula for <strong>relative luminance</strong> is very simple and just takes the RGB value and a set of constants:</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;byte, byte, byte, double&gt; RLum = (r, g, b) =&gt;
    0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b;
</code></pre>

<p>This filter is just a direct translation of the formula but you can implement all kinds of fancy filters. Filtering is so important that it&rsquo;s bound to come up a lot.</p>

<h3 id="color-maps">color maps</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re now left with a 2D array instead of a 3D one so we have to devise a way how to find the colors for our image. When we have a 2D image and we need a 3D (i.e. <strong>colorized</strong>) visual we often utilize a <strong>color map</strong>.</p>

<p>A color map takes a value in a certaain range (let&rsquo;s say <code>0..255</code> in our case) and maps that to another value that represents a color. Let&rsquo;s define the <em>identity</em> color map:</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;int,Color&gt; cmap1 = x =&gt; Color.FromArgb(x, x, x);
</code></pre>

<p>A very simple (and naive) way to do it is just to grayscale our image using the luminance function and then use that luminance value to compute a new color.</p>

<p>By the way, if you think that the nested loop below is horrible code then I can only agree. It <em>is</em> horrible but we&rsquo;ll deal with that later. For now our focus is on understanding and no so much on efficiency.</p>

<pre><code>var @out = new Bitmap(src.Width, src.Height);
for (var y = 0; y &lt; src.Height; y++)
{
    for (var x = 0; x &lt; src.Width; x++)
    {
        var p = src.GetPixel(x, y);
        var rlum = (int)RLum(p.R, p.G, p.B);
        @out.SetPixel(x, y, Color.FromArgb(rlum, rlum, rlum));
    }
}

return @out;
</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, the <code>GetPixel</code> method will return a <code>Color</code> with <code>R</code>, <code>G</code> and <code>B</code> values (stored in a variable called <code>p</code>). The <code>RLum</code> function is what we defined in the section above.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll read through every pixel, get its <code>Color</code> (RGB) value using the <code>GetPixel</code> method and calculate the <strong>relative luminance</strong> using the <code>RLum</code> function and store the result in a variable called <code>rlum</code>. We&rsquo;ll use the value of <code>rlum</code> to calculate new color where <code>R = G = B = rlum</code> (i.e. a grayscale color). Since we know that <code>lum</code> will return something between <code>0</code> and <code>256</code> we can directly feed this value into our new <code>Color</code>.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-we-so-slow">why are we so slow?</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re following along you&rsquo;ll quickly notice that our code is quite slow. On my machine the execution time for even a small 900x600 image is expressed in seconds rather than milliseconds. This is not good.</p>

<p>The reason for this slowness is the usuage of the <code>GetPixel</code> and <code>SetPixel</code> methods. For each call to <code>GetPixel</code> or <code>SetPixel</code> the .NET virtual machine (VM) has to <em>marshal</em> into the underlying C++ GDI DLL. So if we have a 900x600 image that means about <strong>one million</strong> (900x600x2) calls will have to be marshalled and that&rsquo;s where our overhead is.</p>

<h3 id="marshalling">marshalling</h3>

<p>This is the term that&rsquo;s used for interfacing between the .NET virtual machine (which is considerd <strong>safe</strong>) and directly calling into native code in the outside world (in the form of DLL&rsquo;s, which is considered <strong>unsafe</strong>). Even if you&rsquo;re not writing unsafe code there&rsquo;s a lot of marshalling going on behind the scenes without you even realizing it.</p>

<p>And usually, we don&rsquo;t even have to worry about it but in this case, since we&rsquo;re about to do direct memory manipulation we should at least realize what&rsquo;s going on, where the bottleneck is and why our solution works.</p>

<p>For now, it&rsquo;s enough to realize that marshalling a call (or invocation) is quite expensive so you really want to limit the frequency on those invocations. In other words, if you&rsquo;re gonna go unsafe then <strong>make sure you get some heavy lifting done</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="improving">improving</h3>

<p>So now that we (hopefully) understand how a basic filter works, we&rsquo;re going to improve <strong>a lot</strong> on things. We&rsquo;ll not only make it more generic but also a whole lot faster in the process.</p>

<p>The first thing we need is some kind of definition for our filter. I like functional programming and try to define as much as I can in a functional style. A filter is basically a <strong>mapping</strong> over a bitmap so ideally we want to express it as such.</p>

<p>For simplicity, we&rsquo;ll deal with only RGB for now but the principles are the same for any color scheme. We&rsquo;re going to have to go a bit more lower level so we probably have to deal with <code>byte</code> values as well.</p>

<p>We know that a filter (for now) is basically a <code>Color -&gt; Color</code> map. I don&rsquo;t wanna rely on <code>Color</code> though so instead I&rsquo;m going to model a color as a <code>Tuple&lt;byte, byte, byte&gt;</code> which has exactly the bits we need and none of the extra baggage that comes with the <code>Color</code> data structure.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the <code>id</code> filter for reference. The <code>id</code> function just returns its input:</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;Tuple&lt;byte, byte, byte&gt;, Tuple&lt;byte, byte, byte&gt;&gt; id = c =&gt; c;
</code></pre>

<p>And I apologize, <strong>big generic types</strong> are <strong>not pretty</strong> and using <code>Tuple&lt;T1, T2...Tn&gt;</code> is always scary as well. However, I think in this case, the additional mental overhead of <code>Tuple</code> is not that big since it&rsquo;s quite localized and in this specialized domain it should not take too long to understand that a <code>Tuple&lt;byte, byte, byte&gt;</code> represents a color.</p>

<p>The signature basically says that you feed it one triple of RGB values and you get back another triple of RGB values (which might be the equivalent but <strong>it is still another triple</strong>). This signature seems reasonable for a filter.</p>

<h3 id="direct-memory-manipulation">direct memory manipulation</h3>

<p>In order to get rid of this overhead we&rsquo;re gonna do some direct memory manipulation. For someone that is inclined to write things in a functional way this is unnatural but we can still write it in a functional flavor though even though the underlying algorithm is imperative in nature.</p>
