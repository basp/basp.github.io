      <description>Today I spend some time trying to figure out what convolution is. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to find definitions but the problem is that every single one of them seems to assume that I&amp;rsquo;m some kind of math wizard already. That&amp;rsquo;s why we work in from the software engineering side to gain a better understanding.
When I finally realized what it actually meant it dawned on me that I have been doing convulation for decades without even realizing there was a word for it.</description>

      <description>Is LINQPad a replacement for the likes of R, IPython and MATLAB?
Probably not.
Yet, thanks to some nifty libraries, it can come pretty close nowadays.
summary We&amp;rsquo;re going to look at doing some curve fitting for programmers using Math.NET Numerics to do the heavy lifting and OxyPlot for WPF to render our results. We&amp;rsquo;ll be doing this from LINQPad so we can evaluate our results interactively (although you could follow along in any other .</description>

      <description>In the Pascal programming language, there&amp;rsquo;s a clear distinction between callable code that returns a result and callable code that returns nothing. They are called function and procedure respectively. Most programming languages don&amp;rsquo;t really bother to make such a distinction though. Often, procedures are indicated by using a special-purpose none (or null) type. In the C-family of programming languages, this type is called void and in functional programming languages they often call it the unit type.</description>
