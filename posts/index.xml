      <description>In the Pascal programming language, there&amp;rsquo;s a clear distinction between callable code that returns a result and callable code that returns nothing. They are called function and procedure respectively. Most programming languages don&amp;rsquo;t really bother to make such a distinction though. Often, procedures are indicated by using a special-purpose none (or null) type. In the C-family of programming languages, this type is called void and in functional programming languages they often call it the unit type.</description>
