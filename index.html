<p>Welcome to my design lab note space. I'm slowly migrating old notes over here but for updates on <a href="http://github.com/basp/lum-invader/">Oni</a> you've come the the right place.</p>

<p>
	There are two Oni MOO's right now: we have <a href="https://github.com/basp/oni">prototype Oni</a> and we have <a href="https://github.com/basp/lum-invader">Lum Invader</a>. The last repository is the way forward. Old (or classic) Oni (0.0.0) is considered a protoype. It has a some of the desired features but it is not designed well. It's very useful for reference material on certain implementations but it it's also a pretty good demo tool to show what can be accomplished.
